*Usage: ividns <dns_address>
	the program must be run under root privilege

*Procedure:
  -`the program bind to udp port 53(dns).  
  -when a dns packet from a clinet comes, it simply forwards it to <dns_address>
   and waits for  a response from <dns_address>  until time expires. 
   Upon the arrival of the response, resource record whose type is A is 
   converted to AAAA, and the rdata in the record is changed due to the mapping
   method. The the rdatalength field is changed and the label pointers in the 
   message must be recalculated. Two dynamic allocated linked list is generated
   during the calculation, one for the offsets of the A records and one for 
   label pointers. If the conversion succeeds, the new message is sent back to 
   the client.

*Limitation:
  `the program should correctly work under type A, AAAA, CS, NS, PTR, as well 
  as any type whose rdata doesn't contain a domain name or a IPv4 address. 
  For record in the other types, the ipv4 addr in the rdata would remain 
  unconverted and the domain name in the rdata may be misinterpreted if it 
  contained a label pointer. However, wrongly-interpreted record won't affect 
  the interpretion of others resource records.

*Future work:
  -work for more types
